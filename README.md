## A Litle Background

I finally got around to making my own portfolio website, 'cause why not? I had been procrastinating for a bit but finally felt the urge to build it and finish it up.

This site built using SvelteKit 'cause I'm really into this framework. I gotta say, the developer experience is freakin' awesome. As someone who mainly uses Vue, Svelte feels like home, but even better.

So here it is, my online home. I'll be sharing all about me, my activities, projects, writing, and more. Just like a typical portfolio site, but it's all mine.

Clone this repo and run this command (make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed):
