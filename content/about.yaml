    inva, my internet home where I can express my interest in the computing

    I am pretty confident with my web development skills. I
    mainly build websites with Vue and Nuxt in the front and Go with Postgres in
    the back. I also have experience using site builders such as Wordpress.
  - Id love to get new experience with new people and new technology.
